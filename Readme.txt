Files
- Choctangle Case.stl - This is my cad file for the case.  I use Simplify3D to create cole for 3D printer.  When I print I do slow 0,1mm with a raft.
- PCBWay Files.zip - There are 3 files inside.  data.zip is the main file you upload.  When you submit it will ask for yor BOM (lest of parts), which is ProductionBOM.xlsx, and your centroid file (Hub-all-pos.csv).
- PCB Design File (KiCad).zip - PCB design files that created the PCBWay files in case you want to redesign the PCB
- Choctangle-QMK Code.zip - My keyboard code for QMK.  It goes under the keyboards folder in the QMK folder
- Choctangle_default.hex - firmware code.  If you want my exact code, just use the QMK Toolbox (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) to upload 'Choctangle_default.hex'  Otherwise, you can code a new layout.
